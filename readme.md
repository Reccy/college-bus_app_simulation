# Bus Stop!
### Description
"Bus Stop!" is a proof-of-concept Android application that provides the user with accurate real-time bus and timetable information to make commuting more convenient. Notifications for bus delays and heavy traffic with accurate arrival times will keep the user informed of any issues during their commute. The app will also provide the user with statistics such as bus capacity and on-time reliability, along with the ability to remotely hail the bus.

As this is a proof-of-concept application, the data is provided by a Unity simulation of multiple bus routes around Dublin inner-city. This data is collected and is sent to a web server for analysis, which is then read by the Android application.

This project is still under development and is estimated to be completed in May.
